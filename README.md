# Comment-Toxicity
This is a Deep-learning model built to detect the toxicity of comments that are common on social media platforms. The model is deployed using Gradio

# Performance
The model here was trained only for 1 epoch due to resource constraints but training it for around 10 Epochs will probably give the a more accurate model.
